The presenter, Ben Hur, said that “nothing is certain but the “Ads””. He said he will talk about how to effectively find the ad material for individual and current trend of use of intelligence. He started off focusing on the Effective Cost Per Mille (eCPM), that when the ad is given to the user, whether the user will “click” or “ignore” it. It is found by using reactive method (aggregation of historical data) or predictive method (learning from historical data). Reactive method is collecting simple raw data, so using big data and AI, recent businesses are focusing on predictive method. Predicting data using machine intelligence happens through finding ways of minimizing the difference between expected data and the real data. Also he talked about budget smoothing and auto bidding using AI. The 45 minutes of the seminar was quite challenging, that I did not follow with many of the technical terms and mathematical equations he used to explain the logics of the program. So I would say I did not understand even a half of the information the presenter threw at me. Though, I thought it is interesting that the selection procedures of advertisements (filter, rank, price…) were very similar to dplyr functions we used in the class. Also, I learned that since the flooding amount of data nowadays can be helpful, though it is important to select and apply relevant information to the situation.
